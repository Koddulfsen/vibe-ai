# Product Requirements Document: Universal Development Automation Agent System

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines a comprehensive 3-agent system that automates the entire software development workflow from task planning through code execution to quality validation and version control. The system transforms high-level development tasks into completed, tested, and committed code changes without manual intervention.

## 1. Product Overview

### Vision
Create a universal development automation system that can work with any Vibe Master project to intelligently plan, execute, and validate development work while maintaining high code quality and proper version control practices.

### Goals
- **Automate 90%+ of routine development tasks** (dependency installation, file creation, basic implementations)
- **Ensure zero regression** through comprehensive testing and quality gates
- **Maintain clean git history** with meaningful commits and proper branching
- **Work universally** across programming languages and project types
- **Reduce development time** from hours to minutes for common tasks

### Success Metrics
- **Task Completion Rate**: >90% of subtasks completed successfully without manual intervention
- **Quality Gate Pass Rate**: >95% of automated changes pass all quality checks
- **Time Reduction**: 80% reduction in time for routine development tasks
- **Git Hygiene**: 100% of changes properly committed with meaningful messages
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: No automated changes break existing functionality

## 2. Agent Architecture

### Overview
The system consists of 3 specialized agents working in a sequential pipeline:

```
Planning Agent → Execution Agent → Quality & Git Agent
     ↓              ↓                    ↓
"What to do"   "Do the work"     "Validate & commit"
```

## 3. Workflow Integration

### 3.1 Sequential Execution Pipeline

**Step 1: Planning Phase**
1. Planning Agent receives high-level task from Vibe Master
2. Analyzes task complexity and project context
3. Generates intelligent subtasks based on actual needs
4. Creates execution plan with dependencies

**Step 2: Execution Phase**
1. Execution Agent receives next available subtask
2. Interprets task requirements and determines actions
3. Executes development work (installs, creates, implements)
4. Updates task status in Vibe Master

**Step 3: Validation Phase**
1. Quality & Git Agent processes completed subtask
2. Runs appropriate tests and quality checks
3. Updates documentation if needed
4. Commits changes with meaningful message
5. Syncs state across all agents
6. Enforces quality gates before proceeding

### 3.2 Agent Coordination

**State Synchronization:**
- Shared project state file (`.taskmaster/project_state.json`)
- Agent-specific sync files (`.taskmaster/agent_sync/`)
- Real-time coordination to prevent duplicate work

**Quality Gates:**
- Tests must pass before git commit
- Code quality checks must pass before task completion
- No critical errors allowed in pipeline
- Build must succeed before marking tasks done

**Error Handling:**
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Quality gate enforcement stops bad changes
- Rollback capabilities for failed changes
- Error logging and agent notification
