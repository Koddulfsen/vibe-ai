# How the Claude Code Filter Actually Works

## 🤔 Your Question: "How does this work in practice?"

Great question! Let me explain exactly what you need and how to set this up.

## 🎯 The Simple Answer

**Right now**: This is a **manual helper tool** you run BEFORE asking Claude Code complex questions.

**Future goal**: Make it automatic so Claude Code always has this intelligence built-in.

## 🏗️ What You Need (Minimal Setup)

### 1. Files in Your Workspace
```
your-project/
├── your-code-files/
└── tools/
    └── vibe.ai/
        ├── claude_code_filter.py     # The brain
        ├── claude-code-wrapper.py    # The interface
        └── master-agent.py          # Agent coordinator
```

### 2. Python (that's it!)
```bash
# Check if you have Python:
python3 --version

# Install one dependency (optional):
pip install requests
```

## 🎮 How You Use It

### Scenario 1: Simple Question
```bash
# You want to ask: "What is 2+2?"
# Run filter first:
python3 tools/vibe.ai/claude_code_filter.py "what is 2+2?"

# Filter says: ✅ "Handle directly in Claude Code"
# You: Ask Claude Code normally
```

### Scenario 2: Complex Task  
```bash
# You want to ask: "Implement authentication system"
# Run filter first:
python3 tools/vibe.ai/claude_code_filter.py "implement complete authentication"

# Filter says: 🤖 "Use agents first: python3 master-agent.py analyze"
# You: Run the agents first
python3 tools/vibe.ai/master-agent.py analyze

# Agents analyze your project, create plans, etc.
# Then: Ask Claude Code with enhanced context
```

## 🔧 Current Reality vs Future Vision

### ❌ Current Reality (Manual)
```
1. You have a question/task
2. You remember to run the filter
3. Filter tells you: "direct" or "use agents"
4. You follow the recommendation
5. You ask Claude Code
```

### ✅ Future Vision (Automatic)
```
1. You type in Claude Code: "implement authentication"
2. Filter automatically runs in background
3. "This is complex, running agents first..."
4. Agents automatically enhance the context
5. Claude Code gets enhanced results
```

## 🎯 Does This Run Automatically?

**Current answer: NO** - You have to run it manually

**But here's the workflow:**

1. **Before asking Claude Code anything complex:**
   ```bash
   python3 tools/vibe.ai/claude_code_filter.py "your question"
   ```

2. **It tells you:**
   - ✅ "Simple - ask Claude Code directly"
   - 🤖 "Complex - run agents first with this command: ..."

3. **You follow the recommendation**

## 🎪 Try It Right Now

### Test 1: Simple Question
```bash
cd tools/vibe.ai
python3 claude_code_filter.py "what is JavaScript?"
# Should say: ✅ Handle directly
```

### Test 2: Complex Task
```bash
python3 claude_code_filter.py "implement complete user authentication with OAuth"
# Should say: 🤖 Use agents first
```

### Test 3: Interactive Demo
```bash
python3 practical-example.py
# Shows 6 real scenarios and how they're handled
```

## 📁 File Organization

You don't need to change your codebase structure at all! Just add the `tools/vibe.ai/` folder anywhere in your project.

```
Option 1 - In project root:
your-project/
├── src/
├── package.json
└── tools/vibe.ai/

Option 2 - Separate tools folder:
~/dev-tools/
└── vibe.ai/

Option 3 - Global installation:
/usr/local/bin/claude-filter/
```

## 🤖 What the Agents Actually Do

When the filter says "use agents," here's what happens:

1. **Planning Agent**: Analyzes your codebase structure
2. **Execution Agent**: Plans implementation steps  
3. **Quality Agent**: Checks for best practices
4. **Repo Agent**: Manages Git/GitHub integration

They create detailed analysis that Claude Code can use for better results.

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**This is like having a smart assistant** that whispers in your ear:

- "This question is simple, just ask Claude Code"
- "This task is complex, let me prep some analysis first"

**You still use Claude Code normally**, but now you have intelligent preprocessing that makes it much more powerful for complex tasks.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Download/copy the files** to your project
2. **Try the examples** above to see how it works
3. **Use it manually** before complex Claude Code requests
4. **See how it improves your workflow**

The magic is in the **sequential thinking** - it analyzes every request the same way an experienced developer would: "Is this simple enough to handle directly, or complex enough to need specialized help?"
